# Email Contacts App (CRUD with REACT)
This small project is a practice in order to improve my knowledge of the React hooks and React-Router.

## Main Tech stack:
React Library of JavaScript.

## Dependencies:
Axios v0.26.1 (for networking).\
Bootstrap-react v2.2.3 (CSS framework styles).\
Webpack v5.72.0 (included with React).

## Folder structure:
* public: basic auto-generate files by create-react-app (CRA). It contains the index.html.
* src: this folder is the main container of all the code inside the application.
  * apis: it contains the service (contacts.js).
  * components: there are seven react components (some of them have their correspondence CSS file).
  * index.js: entry point of the application as per React standards.
